1. What types of tests you should write

    1. Unit Tests
        Small, fast, isolated
        Examples:
            format functions
            validations
            pure JS logic
            small components
    
    2. Component Tests
        Use React Native Testing Library
        Examples:
            Button press triggers callback
            Form shows errors
            Header renders correctly

    3. Integration Tests
        Test real flow without backend
        Examples:
            Login screen flows
            API hook + component render
            Navigation interactions
    
    4. Optional: E2E Tests (Detox)
        Full device simulation
        Only needed for big enterprise apps.


2. How many tests should a scalable app have?

| Layer       | Minimum Tests |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Utils       | 10–20         |
| Hooks       | 10–30         |
| API         | 20–50         |
| Components  | 30–80         |
| Screens     | 10–30         |
| E2E (Detox) | 3–10          |

Total: 80–150 test files for a medium-scale project.
